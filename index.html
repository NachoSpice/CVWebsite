                <h1>A passion for Game Development</h1>
                <p>
                    I've been creating video games at a very young age,
                    with some of my published projects dating back to 2018 and
                    unpublished ones to as far as 2015.
                    Creating games is a passion for me rather than a hobby and
                    it's the career path I wish to pursue.
                </p>
                <h1>A wide skillset</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm experienced in both 2D and 3D development, with my portfolio
                    being comprised of various projects from both categories. Admittedly,
                    I specialise more in 3D, but no 2D project is scary to me.
                    I am familiar with software such as Godot, Blender and various other
                    pieces of software useful in making games.
